      Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way:
      <ol>
        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today: 
      <ul>
       <li>Passing cars</li>
       <li>When you can't see</li>
       <li>May get you</li>
       <li>A glimpse, Of eternity</li>
      </ul>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.

      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod,
      digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway."
